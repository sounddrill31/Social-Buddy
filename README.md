## About
A simple expressive home-made open source Buddy made with lying around hobbyist parts, powered by an esp32. Because of this, it will try to be infinitely hackable, allowing end users to install their own firmware or features if they wish.

Loosely inspired by the tamagotchi community and community-made desk toys, it will react to its surroundings through external stimulus(like movement or touch), and expresses itself accordingly through the display!

Currently uses MicroPython for the code, and a buzzer to make reaction noises.

## Specs
Expectations for Technical Specs:
- ESP32 Variant with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- IIC OLED Display
- Battery Powered, preferably rechargeable with lithium-ion batteries 
- Piezo Buzzer/Mini Speaker
- MPU6050 or better Accelerometer
